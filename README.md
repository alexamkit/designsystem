* *Work in progress*

### Pain relievers
* **Reference** components
* **Automate** build process
* *Work in progress*

### Product/Service/Outcome

#### Highlevel

* *Work in progress*
* **Everybody:** use **Git or Github or Gitlab** to versioning and share
* **Designer:** check [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) to maintain content (sweet interface)
* **Designer:** check [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to serve content (markdown to html via jekyll)
* **Designer:**: check Git Large File Storage [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* **Developer:** check [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to integrate documentation within your app repository
* **Everybody:** check [Github CI](https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration) 
  * to build your shit in an automated way (listen to push on master)
  * to serve a wrapper template around your repositories (design / dev)
  * to map and sync both repositories through componentID, variantID and versionID
* **Everybody**: check visual regression testing to maintain binaries (automated visual testing)
* **Everybody**: develop a solid repository structure. Mine would be an adapted atomic design pattern (styles, atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, flows)

#### Lowlevel

* *Work in progress*
* **Designer:** this could be an interface deployed via **Github CI / Github Pages** ![lowlevel-designsystem](designsystem.png)

## Installation

* **Designer:** create a **Gitbook Account** and integrate your Github repository
* **Designer:** change **Github Setting**s to activate Github Pages
* *Work in progress*
